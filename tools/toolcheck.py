"""the C build tools against the python ones they replace.

0.3.21 is the entry that is easy to miss and blocks everything: six of
this project's build tools are python, and a self-hosting machine has no
python and is not getting one. so each becomes a C program, and each
swap is a chance to change the build's output by accident.

so while both exist, both run, and the output is compared. that is the
same argument as every other check here: the old implementation is the
oracle, and it is the only thing that knows the details nobody wrote
down.

when a python tool goes away, its case here goes with it, and what is
left is a C tool checked against nothing, which is why the C ones are
introduced *beside* the python ones rather than instead of them.
