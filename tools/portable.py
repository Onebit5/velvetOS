"""compile the portable kernel against an architecture that does nothing.

tools/checkarch.py greps. it can see an #include of an x86 header and a
line of inline assembly, and it cannot see a portable file that quietly
*depends* on something only x86 supplies, a constant, a struct layout,
a function it happens to link against. that is the difference between a
boundary nobody has crossed lately and a boundary that holds.

so this compiles the portable half of the kernel against
kernel/arch/none/, where every arch function is empty and every arch
constant is a plausible-looking lie. if it compiles, nothing above the
line needs a machine. if it does not, the compiler says which file and
which line, which is a better answer than any list I could keep by hand.

then it links what it compiled and collects the *undefined* symbols. that
list is the porting checklist, worked out mechanically rather than by
somebody trying to remember what an architecture owes the kernel, and
it is why `make portable-check` is worth having beyond this one version:
an architecture is finished when it defines everything on the list, which
is a question with an answer.
