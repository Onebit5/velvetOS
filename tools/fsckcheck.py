"""break a filesystem on purpose, and see whether fsck notices.

a checker that agrees about a clean filesystem has agreed about
nothing. every check in `kernel/fs/fsck.c` is here as a *break*: an
image is damaged in one specific way, fsck is run over it, and the run
has to find that kind of problem and no other.

and then the half that matters more. fsck does not only report, it
mends what has exactly one right answer. so for those, the image is
mended and handed to `tools/readext4.py`, which shares no line with the
checker or the driver, and which has to call the result clean. that is
the only way to know a repair repaired anything: my checker saying it
fixed something is my checker's opinion of my checker.

the breaks that must *not* be mended are just as important. a block two
files both claim has no right answer, one of them is wrong and
nothing on the disk says which, and an fsck that picks one is an fsck
that destroys data while reporting success.
