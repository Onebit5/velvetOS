"""read the source tree back out of the boot image, and hold it against
the tree it was supposed to be.

0.3.26 writes the project's own source into velvetos.img, past the
ramdisk, at sectors philemon's table names. everything that puts it
there is mine, a line of the makefile, a python tool, a C reader,
and a source tree that is checked only by the code that wrote it is a
source tree nobody has actually read.

so this starts from the image and works outwards, the way readext4.py
does with a filesystem:

    the boot table says where the archive is
    python's tarfile reads it, which is somebody else's tar reader
    every file in it is compared, byte for byte, with the working tree
    every file git tracks has to be in it
    and the sha-1 of the whole archive has to appear inside the kernel,
      which is how the machine knows its own source at runtime

the last one is the one worth having. an archive and a kernel sitting in
the same image are two files that happen to be adjacent; the stamp is
what makes them a claim about each other, and a stamp nothing checks is
a claim nobody has tested.
