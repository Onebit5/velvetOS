"""does the arch boundary actually hold?

0.2.20 drew a line: everything under kernel/arch/x86_64/ assumes this
machine, and everything above it is not supposed to. a line like that is
worth exactly as much as whatever checks it, it decays the first time
somebody needs a `hlt` in a hurry, and it decays silently, because the
kernel goes on building and booting perfectly.

so this is the thing that notices. it fails the build on:

  * inline assembly outside kernel/arch/
  * an #include of arch/x86_64/... from outside kernel/arch/, unless
    the file is on the list below

and it prints the list every time, because the list is the interesting
output. it is a record of what has not been done yet, and it is meant to
shrink, a version that adds a name to it should have said why.

the same idea as tools/checkfmt.py, and for the same reason: the bug it
prevents is one that hides.

# the question of which are "an x86 driver" and which merely "happen to
# use port io" was answered for exactly one of them, and the answer came
# from writing a second architecture: drivers/serial.c was a terminal
# with a chip stuck to it, and the terminal half is off this list now.
#
# the rest are still here because that port was removed before it could
# say anything about them. the list is the record of what has not been
# asked yet, and it is meant to shrink.
#
# what it buys in the meantime is that the leak is *counted* rather than
# assumed, and see tools/portable.py, which is the half of this that
# does not grep, and which catches what grep cannot.
