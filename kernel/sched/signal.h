/*
 * signals. not a message: there is no queue and no payload, a signal is a
 * *bit* in a word, so raising one that is already raised changes nothing
 * and two ctrl+c presses in the same instant are one interrupt. a process
 * either ignores it, takes the default action, or has a handler to run,
 * and the default is nearly always die, the exceptions being the
 * interesting ones, SIGCHLD arrives constantly and a default of death
 * would mean every shell exiting the moment a command finished. SIGKILL
 * and SIGSTOP may not be caught, blocked or ignored, which is the entire
 * reason a machine can still be saved by somebody who can type.
 *
 * delivery is the easy half. every blocking call here was written assuming
 * it finishes for one of two reasons, what it waited for happened or the
 * thing it waited on went away, and a signal is a third, so a call that
 * does not know about it either sleeps through the interrupt or returns as
 * though it succeeded. a blocked thread carrying a deliverable signal is
 * therefore woken and the call returns "interrupted" rather than a result,
 * and that has to reach the program, a read that returns 0 on an interrupt
 * being indistinguishable from end of file
