 * locks, at last. this kernel spent a long time using `cli` as mutual
 * exclusion, which was correct for one core, since the only thing that
 * could interrupt a critical section was an interrupt. it stopped being
 * correct the moment a second core could run kernel code, and every one of
 * those call sites was quietly reclassified by a change that did not touch
 * any of them.
 *
 * so a real lock, and both halves of the problem at once: a critical
 * section usually needs protecting from this core's own interrupts and
 * from the other cores, and needs both or neither. spin_lock_irq does both
 * and hands back the flags, so it drops into the shape irq_save and
 * irq_restore already had.
 *
 * two locks taken in opposite orders by two cores is a machine that stops
 * with no fault and nothing printed, and the only defence is a rank every
 * lock declares and never violates: a lock may only be taken while holding
 * locks of lower rank. it is checked, not hoped for
