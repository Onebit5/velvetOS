 * first thing in it, so the two agree by construction rather than by
 * anybody remembering to keep them in step.

 * pid *0* is the other special number and is not a process at all: it is
 * what the kernel shell uses, since a shell here is a kernel thread. the
 * difference matters to exactly one rule, and it is the important one,
 * a process whose parent is 0 belongs to a shell that waits for its own
