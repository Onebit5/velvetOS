/*
 * ext2's answer to "where is block N of this file" is a list of block
 * numbers, one per block, with indirection once the list outgrows the
 * inode. it is exact, and it is enormous: a gigabyte in 1 KiB blocks is
 * a million numbers, four megabytes of pointers, and reading the file
 * means reading them.
 *
 * an extent says the other thing: *the next N logical blocks live at
 * physical block P*. a file written in one go is one extent whatever
 * its size, and the twelve bytes that say so sit in the inode. that is
 * the difference ext4 is actually about, not a bigger ext2, a
 * different sentence about where a file is.
 *
 * the shape is a tree, and the header at the top of every node says how
 * deep it is. depth 0 means the twelve-byte records after the header
 * are extents. deeper means they are indices, each naming a block with
 * another header at the top of it. the inode's sixty bytes hold a
 * header and four records, so a file in four pieces or fewer costs no
 * blocks at all to describe.
 *
 *
 * reading walks any depth up to five, which is deeper than ext4 itself
 * goes. writing builds depth 0 and depth 1, which with these blocks is
 * four leaves of eighty-four extents apiece, three hundred and
 * thirty-six runs, any of them up to thirty-two thousand blocks. a file
 * this machine cannot describe that way is a file it has no room for.
 * deeper than that is refused rather than half-built.
