/*
 * arp: the question "who has this address, and where do the kernel sends to reach
 * them", asked by shouting it at everybody.
 *
 * it is the oldest thing on the wire that is still exactly as it was,
 * and it is worth seeing why it has to exist at all. ip addresses are
 * something people assign; ethernet addresses are burned into cards.
 * nothing connects the two except asking. so a machine that wants to
 * send to 10.0.2.2 broadcasts "who has 10.0.2.2?", and whoever does
 * answers with their own hardware address.
 *
 * the answer is then *remembered*, because doing that for every packet
 * would double the traffic on the wire. that cache is the whole of the
 * state in this file, and it is also the whole of the danger: nothing
 * authenticates a reply, so anybody on the wire can claim any address.
 * that is not a flaw the kernel is going to fix here, it is how arp works
 * everywhere, but it is worth writing down rather than discovering.
