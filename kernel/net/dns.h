/*
 * dns: turning a word into an address, and the first time this machine
 * asks a question of software somebody else wrote years ago, whose only
 * sensible posture is to believe none of it.
 *
 * a header of twelve bytes, then a question, then answers. a name is
 * length-prefixed labels ending in a zero byte, so the dots in a name are
 * exactly the label boundaries.
 *
 * compression is the whole of the danger. a name may be cut short by a
 * pointer whose remaining fourteen bits are an offset into the message,
 * and a pointer may point backwards, forwards or at itself, so a decoder
 * that simply follows them can be hung forever by a fourteen-byte reply,
 * and one can be made to point into the middle of a length byte so that a
 * name decodes out of a region that was never a name. so every jump is
 * counted and bounded, every offset is checked against the message before
 * it is followed, and a name that has not ended when the budget runs out
 * is refused rather than truncated, since a truncated name resolves to
 * *something* and something is what gets connected to.
 *
 * no recursion of its own, the question is asked with the recursion bit
 * set and a real resolver does the walking. no AAAA, no TXT, no MX, no
 * zone transfers, and one question per query
