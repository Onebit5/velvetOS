/*
 * the wire. everything in this directory is about one idea: a network
 * protocol is almost entirely *arithmetic over a byte buffer*. a header is
 * a set of offsets, a checksum is a sum, an address is four bytes, none of
 * it needs a card and almost none of it needs a kernel. so the card is one
 * file and the rest is pure, which means every protocol here can be tested
 * against packets written by hand and against real captured ones.
 *
 * the wire is big-endian and this machine is not, so every multi-byte field
 * in every header has to be turned around, and forgetting one is the most
 * common bug in the subject: it produces a packet that looks almost right
 * and is silently discarded by everything that receives it.
 *
 * so there are no structs overlaid on packets, only explicit get and put
 * functions at explicit offsets, the same way fs/ext4.c reads a superblock:
 * the offsets *are* the format, and a struct is a claim about padding and
 * order that the compiler is free to reinterpret

 * two properties make it worth understanding rather than copying. it is
 * *endian-neutral*, summing the bytes in the wrong order gives the
 * same answer byte-swapped, which is why so many implementations are
 * accidentally correct. and summing a block that already contains its
 * own checksum gives zero, which is how a receiver checks one without
 * having to know where the field was.
 *
 * it is accumulated rather than computed in one call because udp needs a
 * *pseudo-header*, addresses that are not in the datagram at all, to
 * be summed together with the datagram. one call per piece, and the
 * pieces need not be even lengths, which is the part that is usually
