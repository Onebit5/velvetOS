 * the card can say so instead. what an interrupt handler is *allowed to
 * do* is the whole of the design here, and the answer is: read the cause
 * register, and wake somebody. it does not parse a frame, take the
 * interface's lock, or answer an arp, all of that happens on an
 * ordinary thread that can block, print and take locks in any order it
 * likes. the poll loop did not go away; it stopped guessing when to run.
 *
 * "wake a thread" is only legal because of something the scheduler
 * already did: every one of the seventeen places that takes sched_lock
 * takes it with interrupts off. so this interrupt cannot land on a core
 * that is already holding the lock the wake needs, which is the deadlock
 * this design would otherwise have. it is not a new rule, but it is the
 * rule that decides what the handler may do, and it was worth checking
 * before relying on it rather than after.
 *
 * this is also the first pci device in this kernel to use an interrupt
 * at all. the keyboard, the mouse and the timer are isa parts on lines
 * that have not moved since 1981; a pci interrupt is level-triggered,
 * shared with whatever else the firmware put on that line, and switched
 * off by a bit in the command register that nothing here had ever had
 * to clear.
