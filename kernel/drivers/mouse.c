 * sign bits for the two movement bytes that follow.
 *
 * that always-set bit is the only way to tell where a packet starts. the
 * 8042 has no framing, if one byte is dropped or one arrives before
 * the driver is listening, every packet after it is read one byte out of
 * step and the pointer flies off in a straight line. checking the bit
 * and throwing the byte away is the whole of the fix, and it is why the
