 * one ring per console, and that is not tidiness, it is the only
 * arrangement in which the question has one answer.
 *
 * with a single ring, four shells all block on it and a keypress wakes
 * every one of them; whichever the scheduler happens to pick takes the
 * character. gating *afterwards*, checking whether the reader is on
 * the console being looked at, and putting the key back if not, is a
 * race with extra steps, because by then somebody has already been
 * woken and something has already been consumed.
 *
 * so a key goes into the ring of whichever console is on the screen,
 * and a reader only ever looks at its own. a shell on a console nobody
 * is watching is not competing for keys; it is asleep on a queue that
 * nothing is filling. 16 bits wide because arrow keys dont fit in a
