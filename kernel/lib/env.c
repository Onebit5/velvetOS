 * an environment as a block of "NAME=value" strings, each ended by a NUL
 * and the lot by an empty string. that is what makes inheriting one a
 * single memcpy, and inheriting is most of what an environment is for: a
 * table of pointers would need every one of them rewritten on the way
 * into a child.
 *
 * it lives here rather than in process.c because the shell needs exactly
 * these operations and has no process to perform them on, so one
 * implementation serves two callers. every operation is a walk, which is
 * fine for tens of entries read at typing speed
