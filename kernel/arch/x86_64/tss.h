 *    certain exceptions fire, whether or not the current stack is

 *    page fault happens with rsp already inside the unmapped page, so
 *    the cpu cant push an exception frame, and without an IST that
 *    second failure becomes a double fault with nowhere to land and
 *    then a triple fault, which on real hardware is just a reboot.
 *
 *  - rsp0, the stack the cpu switches to on a ring 3 -> ring 0 trap.
 *    nothing uses it yet, but usermode will
