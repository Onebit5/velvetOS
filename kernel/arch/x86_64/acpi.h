 * pointers to other tables, one of which is the madt, which says where
 * the local apic lives, where the io apics live, and which of the old
 * isa irq numbers have been quietly renumbered on this machine.
 *
 * that last part is the one that bites. the pit is wired to irq 0 and
 * everyone knows it, except that on most real machines it arrives at
 * the io apic on a different line, and the only way to know which is to
 * read the override entries. a kernel that assumes gets no timer.
