the system calls

the abi between ring 3 and the kernel: what a program can ask for, what
it passes, and what it gets back. the numbers are the kernel's and are
deliberately few, since there is no libc out there to satisfy, only the
handful of things a program here could want.

the kernel side
---------------

the door between ring 3 and here. numbers are the kernel's, deliberately small in number, there is no libc out there to satisfy, only the handful of things a program in this kernel could want

four calls here are for a program drawing whole screens, and a shell needs none of them: it prints a prompt, reads a line and prints an answer, and the console keeps the cursor where the printing left it. an editor cannot work that way. it paints the entire screen, puts the cursor somewhere in the middle of what it painted, and waits for one keystroke rather than a line. getkey is the interesting one, because it is *also* how raw mode arrives. there is no flag anywhere saying "this terminal is raw": asking for a line gets the line discipline with its echo and its backspace handling, and asking for a key gets the key. the two questions are different, so they are different calls, and nothing has to remember which mode anything is in

what a file is, for anyone who wants to know without reading it. this layout is duplicated in userland/syscall.h, which is what an abi is: two sides agreeing on where the fields sit, with nothing to enforce it but the fact that they were written together. the padding is explicit so that neither side's compiler gets to decide it

three calls are the smallest set that lets a program use udp: claim a port, send to somebody, take what arrived. there is no `connect` and no `accept`, because udp has neither, a socket here hears from everybody and says who each datagram came from, which is what makes a udp server one port rather than a connection per talker. recvfrom does not block. it says "nothing yet" and the program sleeps and asks again, which is a poll rather than a wait, honest for a kernel with no way yet to park a thread on a socket, and it keeps the receive path out of the business of waking anybody

waiting, rather than asking again in a loop. every one of these takes a timeout in milliseconds, 0 to look and move on, which is exactly what recvfrom did before, and negative to wait as long as it takes

who a datagram came from, filled in by recvfrom. a struct rather than two more registers because the syscall abi has six and recvfrom would otherwise want seven

everything ring 3 was holding when it made the call, written down by the entry stub in the order it pushes them. this exists for fork and for nothing else. a forked child has to come back from a syscall it never made, holding exactly what its parent held, and the callee-saved half of that is in the cpu at the moment of the call and gone a moment later, buried under some C prologue. the layout is the stack layout. changing either without the other is a program that resumes with its registers shuffled, which is the kind of bug that looks like the compiler being wrong

fifteen registers, fifteen pushes. this catches a field appearing or going away and cannot catch a reordering, for that the only real check is reading the two exit paths in `objdump -d bin/velvetos --disassemble=syscall_entry` and `--disassemble=fork_return` and seeing the same order twice

leave for ring 3 through a frame rather than through a call. rax is zeroed on the way out, because the only caller is a forked child and that is how it finds out it is the child

how many times each has been asked for, and what to call it. the numbers are the cheapest possible picture of what a program actually does, one line of arithmetic per call, and afterwards you can say with certainty which door gets used

which kernel stack `syscall` should land on. the scheduler keeps this pointed at the running thread, exactly like the tss rsp0

where this core's kernel stack is, for the entry stub to stand on. per core, not global: the scheduler on one core must not be able to rewrite the stack another core is about to use

the libc side
-------------

``userland/syscall.h`` wraps each of these in a function, so a program
calls ``write(1, buf, len)`` rather than the number. the wrappers are one
instruction and a return value, and the shape of each is the argument
list above.
