docs
====

velvetOS is a tiny 64-bit kernel for x86_64, written in C, booted by a
bootloader of its own. this is its documentation: what each part is, why it
is the way it is, and how to work on it.

it is split in two. the pages here at the root are *about the project*: how
to build it, how to test it, how to write and send a change. the pages
under `subsystems/ <subsystems/index.rst>`_ are *about the code*. one page
per subsystem, saying what it is for and what it decided.

the short version of the machine is in `README.md <../README.md>`_; where it
is going is `ROADMAP.md <../ROADMAP.md>`_, and where it has been is
`CHANGELOG.md <../CHANGELOG.md>`_.

start here
----------

if you are building it for the first time: `building <building.rst>`_.

if you are changing it: `code style <coding-style.rst>`_, then `testing
<testing.rst>`_, then `contributing <contributing.rst>`_.

if you are reading it: `layout <layout.rst>`_ for the map, then the
subsystem page you care about.

about the project
-----------------

- `code style <coding-style.rst>`_: how to write the code, name things,
  comment, and handle errors; the TODO/FIXME convention.
- `contributing <contributing.rst>`_: the workflow, commit messages,
  sign-off, review, patches by email, and the rule that CI is the gate.
- `building <building.rst>`_: the toolchain, every make target, running
  it, and the self-hosting build.
- `testing <testing.rst>`_: the host suites, the checks against other
  implementations, the boot test, and what CI runs.
- `layout <layout.rst>`_: the source tree and the subsystem map.
- `releases <versioning.rst>`_: how versions are cut, and why they are not
  in the log.

the subsystems
--------------

- `the architecture boundary <subsystems/arch.rst>`_: ``arch/``, and the
  one rule the build enforces.
- `philemon <subsystems/boot.rst>`_: the bootloader and the handoff.
- `memory <subsystems/mm.rst>`_: frames, heap, page tables, demand paging,
  copy on write, pressure.
- `scheduling and processes <subsystems/sched.rst>`_: threads, the
  scheduler, locks, processes, signals, init.
- `filesystems <subsystems/fs.rst>`_: the namespace, the ramdisk, fat32,
  ext4, the journal, the block cache, partitions, pipes.
- `drivers <subsystems/drivers.rst>`_: console, serial, terminal, keyboard,
  mouse, timers, pci, sata, partitions.
- `networking <subsystems/net.rst>`_: ethernet through tcp, sockets, dhcp,
  dns, http.
- `the library <subsystems/lib.rst>`_: printing, strings, checksums,
  deflate, dates, symbols.
- `the shell <subsystems/shell.rst>`_: the velvet room terminal.
- `the userland <subsystems/userland.rst>`_: the libc, the syscalls, the
  programs.
- `the system calls <syscalls.rst>`_: the abi between ring 3 and the kernel,
  every call with the arguments it takes and what it gives back.
- `the toolchain <subsystems/toolchain.rst>`_: the assembler, linker, make,
  ar, mkext4, git.
- `the tools <subsystems/tools.rst>`_: the python checkers and image
  builders.
