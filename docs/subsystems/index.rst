subsystems
==========

one page per subsystem: what ``kernel/<name>/`` is for, what it decided,
and what it deliberately does not do. the map of the whole tree is in
`layout <../layout.rst>`_.

- `the architecture boundary <arch.rst>`_. ``arch/``
- `philemon <boot.rst>`_. ``boot/``
- `memory <mm.rst>`_. ``mm/``
- `scheduling and processes <sched.rst>`_. ``sched/``
- `filesystems <fs.rst>`_. ``fs/``
- `drivers <drivers.rst>`_. ``drivers/``
- `networking <net.rst>`_. ``net/``
- `the library <lib.rst>`_. ``lib/``
- `the shell <shell.rst>`_. ``shell/``
- `the userland <userland.rst>`_. ``userland/``
- `the toolchain <toolchain.rst>`_. the assembler, linker, make, ar, git
- `the tools <tools.rst>`_. ``tools/``

each page is written to be read on its own, but they do lean on each other:
the arch boundary comes up in memory and scheduling, the filesystem pages
reference the block cache and the journal, and the userland page needs the
syscall layer described in scheduling and processes.
